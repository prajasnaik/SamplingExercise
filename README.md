# Assignment 1 - Applied Probability and Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment 1 of the Applied Probability and Statistics course. The assignment implements various statistical sampling and distribution methods.

## Files

- `docs\THEORY.md`: Contains detailed theoretical explanations for the statistical concepts and methods used in this assignment.
- `assignment1.py`: Python script to generate statistical samples.
- `plotting.py`: Python script to generate plots based on the samples.
- `helpers\errors.py` : Python script defining custom exeption.
- `helpers\probability_density_functions.py` : Python script with functions that return pdf based on input x. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Matplotlib: For generating plots

You can install these prerequisites using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prajasnaik/SamplingExercise.git
    cd SamplingExercise
    ```

2. To generate statistical samples:
    ```bash
    python assignment1.py
    ```

3. To create plots visualizing the data:
    ```bash
    python plotting.py
    ```
